"I decided to conduct a special military operation. Her goal...I haven't thought of it yet! ...hhmm... Protection of members of the Federation! We will invade the planet Tatooine, since it is not yet part of the composition Federation. We will capture the planet. And establish a New Imperial Peace!"

"Alliance, I appeal on behalf of the people of Tatooine!
                    We are fighting to be equal members of the alliance. I believe that today we show that
                    with us the alliance will be stronger, without you the planet will be lonely. We proved our
                    strength that we, at least,
                    the same as you. Prove that you are with us, that you will not let us go, prove that you are
                    truly worthy of the alliance titles, and then life will conquer death and the world over
                    darkness. Glory to Tatooine!‚Äù
